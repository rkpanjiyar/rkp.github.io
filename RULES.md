# Advanced Rules
## Rule 1:
Must reposition when already making 20%, Refer to rule 2 for more details
## Rule 2:
We must know the next support resistance levels of stock(which updates daily and has to be updated in Excel every morning), so simulate straddle based on these.

>  * If stock goes down(but we and the analysts are bullish) reposition.
>  * If the stock hits the next resistance level, plan to take a profit. (so profit percentage will be different for each stock)
