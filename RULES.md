Below rules we will always follow

# Basic Rules 
* Always buy stradel never single leg.
* Expiry must minimum n day after nearest earning date. 

# Advanced Rules
* Rule 1: Must reposition when already making 20%
* Rule 2: we must know next support resistance levels of stock(which updates daily and has to be updated in excel evey morning), so simulate straddle based on these.
* if stock goes down(but we and analysts are bullish) reposition.
* if stock hits next resistance level, plan to take profit.(so profit percentage will be different for each stock)
