Below are rules we will always follow

# Basic Rules 
* Always buy stradel never single leg.
* Expiry must be a minimum of N days after the nearest earning date. 

# Advanced Rules
* Rule 1: Must reposition when already making 20%
* Rule 2: we must know the next support resistance levels of stock(which updates daily and has to be updated in Excel every morning), so simulate straddle based on these.
  * if stock goes down(but we and the analysts are bullish) reposition.
  * if the stock hits the next resistance level, plan to take a profit. (so profit percentage will be different for each stock)
